    <section class="section"><h2>About Indy's Campaign</h2>
      <p>Indy's Campaign grew from a simple idea: that the people who live in Indianapolis neighborhoods know best what those neighborhoods need, and that organized communities have the power to create the change they want to see. What started as a small group of concerned citizens has grown into a vibrant organization that engages thousands of Indianapolis residents in civic life.</p>
      <p>We are nonpartisan in our approach. We believe that community improvement transcends political affiliation, and that the most effective solutions come from bringing diverse perspectives together around shared goals. Our work focuses on issues, not parties — and on results, not rhetoric.</p>
      <p>Our programs span the full spectrum of civic engagement, from voter registration and education to neighborhood planning and policy advocacy. We believe that a healthy democracy requires active citizens, and we work to lower every barrier that prevents Indianapolis residents from participating fully in the decisions that shape their lives.</p></section>
