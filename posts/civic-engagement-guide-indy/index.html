    <article class="section"><h2>A Citizen's Guide to Civic Engagement in Indianapolis</h2>
      <p>Indianapolis operates under a consolidated city-county government known as Unigov, which combines the City of Indianapolis and Marion County under a single mayor and a 25-member City-County Council. Understanding this structure is the first step toward effective civic engagement.</p>
      <p>The City-County Council is the legislative body for Indianapolis-Marion County, responsible for budgets, ordinances, and zoning decisions. Council meetings are open to the public and include opportunities for public comment. Attending these meetings — even just to observe — provides valuable insight into how decisions that affect your neighborhood are made.</p>
      <p>Indianapolis has a robust system of neighborhood associations that serve as the primary conduit between residents and city government. These volunteer-led organizations address local concerns, coordinate with city departments, and advocate for neighborhood priorities. Joining your neighborhood association is one of the most impactful things you can do as an engaged citizen.</p>
      <p>The Mayor's Neighborhood Advocates serve as liaisons between city government and neighborhood organizations, helping to navigate city services, communicate community concerns, and facilitate responses to local issues. Knowing your Neighborhood Advocate is a valuable resource for getting things done.</p>
      <p>Beyond formal structures, Indianapolis offers numerous opportunities for civic engagement: volunteering with community development corporations, participating in public planning processes, serving on boards and commissions, attending candidate forums, and simply talking with neighbors about the issues that affect your community.</p>
      <p>Effective civic engagement is a long game. Building relationships, understanding processes, showing up consistently, and working collaboratively with others who share your goals — these are the habits that create lasting community impact.</p>
